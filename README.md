MKV
===
A small binary for cleaning up the metadata on MKV files.

It will set the title and track names for each track in the file.
The title of the movie will be the same as the filename so just rename it to what
you want before running the script.

Requirements
---
* Ruby
* [mkvtoolnix] (http://www.bunkus.org/videotools/mkvtoolnix/) (easiest installed via `brew install mkvtoolnix`)

Usage
---
`ruby mkv <path/to/movie.mkv>` (now supports multiple files for batch cleanup)
